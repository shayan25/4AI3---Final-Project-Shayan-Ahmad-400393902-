# Project 4: Generate new photograph
# Source: CIFAR-10 dataset

# Note: This project is based on the Generative Adversarial Model (GAN) which will get covered at the end of this course. So, choose this project only if you are willing to learn the functionality in advance and prepare the project.


# Description:
# Machine learning has covered almost all industries and it has helped humans to mimic human-like behavior. Additionally, there are quite a few tasks where ML algorithms are proven better than humans where humans have physical limi-tations to achieve the task. One such interesting area is Image generation. A few of the fields where image generation can be useful are redressing a person with a given outfit or glasses, providing measurement of the cloth based on a photo of a person, identifying the image of a person after 25 years, etc.

# The CIFAR-10 dataset (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research) is a collection of images that are commonly used to train machine learning and computer vision algorithms. It is one of the most widely used datasets for machine learning rese-arch. The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The 10 different classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. There are 6,000 images of each class.

# The scope of this project is to generate a new image that is not available in real life, based on a model trained using the Generative Adversarial Model (GAN).


# Project Outcomes:
# • Preprocess and clean the data.
# • Explore various options of GAN to find the most optimized model.
# • Generate a new image with a newly trained algorithm.
